2. Should authentication etc. be provided by the RPC framework, or by the functions that use the RPC framework? 

3. What transport layer protocol should be used? What are the trade-offs? 

4. In which function(s) should the socket(s) be created? 

5. Should rpc_client and rpc_server be allocated dynamically or statically? What are the implications for the client and server code? 


6. What happens if one host uses big-endian byte order and the other uses little-endian? How does that relate to “network byte order”?
